This repository kind of documents my journey through Phil Town's book 'Rule #1'.
I started creating this utility to both practise Python and to better understand Phil's book
through coding the ideas he talks about. I plan to make rule1 into a proper command line utility that can perform all the
basic checks and calculations and can output the results as a nicely formatted spreadsheet. It currently uses https://stockrow.com
as its data source which might be subject to change if stockrow introduces proper subscriptions.
